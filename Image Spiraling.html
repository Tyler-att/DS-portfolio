                    <p>
                        So this is mostly just a little fun project of mine. I was inspired by a video I had seen a while ago that discussed sorting images by various pixel 
                        properties (e.g. brightness, color, etc.). That particular video sorted each pixel linearly across the matrix of pixels, but I wanted to see if I could 
                        sort some images in a spiraling fashion.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Now, when I started this project, I didn't have a lot of experience with image manipulation in python (or any language, for that matter), so there were a 
                        few things I had to learn. This project was mostly an exercise in problem solving. The final code isn't particularly complex, but since I was in new 
                        territory here, this was good practice in breaking down complex problems into smaller, more easily managed parts.

                    <p>
                        So before I could even start working on solving this problem, I needed to figure out how python interprets images. First things first, a quick pip install
                        followed by <br />
                        <pre><code>from cv2 import imread, imwrite, imshow, waitKey</code></pre><br />
                        and now we are in business. I took some random photo I found online and used the imread function to determine what the image ends up becoming. Looks like
                        the images are converted into numnpy arrays. OK, so that's famailiar territory to me, so I can work with that.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        OK, so if I'm going to try to spiral in image, I'm going to need to figure out what I even mean by that. What I'm invisioning is the equivalent of all of
                        the pixels above the center point moving right, below the center point moving left, etc.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        My original plan was to find the center point in the matrix, scan through each pixel, and then adjust their rows and columns based on their location
                        relative to the center. For instance, a pixel immediately to the right would go down one row, but a pixel down and to the right would go down one row and
                        left one column. This of course led to some major diffulties such as certain pixels ending up in the same location, corner pixels ending up outside the
                        picture, and empty holes being left in random locations. Fortunately, after a number of failed iterations of that program, I realized that, if I were
                        working with a list instead of a matrix, all I would need to do is take the last item in the list and move it to the very front of the list.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        So with that in mind, I turned my thoughts towards how to transform a matrix into a spiraled list, like so:<br />
                        <br />
                        We want to convert
                        <br /><br /><pre>

[7,  8,  9,  10, 11, 12]
[13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]
[19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]
[25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]
                        </pre>
                        into<br />
                        <br />
                        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 19, 13, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 17, 23, 22, 21, 20, 14, 15, 16]<br />
                        So the first step in getting
                        
                        The R^2 value for this model is 0.96, but it is clear the model is overfit. <br />
                        There are actually a few key hints for this, the first being the non-significant p-values for most of the factors. Normally, the use of
                        R^2-adj would be an indicator for an over-fit model, but in this case, it is 0.93, which is very close to the R^2. However, if we go through
                        the effort to calculate R^2-pred, we will see a major drop: 0.81.

                    <code>
pr <- residuals(lm.O1) /(1 - lm.influence(lm.O1)$hat)
      PRESS <- sum(pr^2)
O1.anova <- anova(lm.O1)
tss <- sum(O1.anova$"Sum Sq")
R2P <- 1 - PRESS/(tss)
R2P
                        </code>

                    <p>
                        One can also look at the residuals for an indication of an issue. Here, there is a bit of a challenge, as there are only 30 measurements total.
                        This can make it difficult to assess normality with high levels of confidence, but in this case the normality does appear to be somewhat off.
                        Similarly, the residuals vs fits graph looks like it is increasing here, but this could be due entirely to chance. There are only two values that fit
                        greater than 200 (as expected with a response surface design), and these two are a little high, but with only two it's hard to tell.

                    <p>
                        With this new model, you can see that all of the p-values are now significant.
                        Additionally, our R^2 is now 0.95, only a 0.01 drop. Our R^2-pred, however,
                        is now 0.91, a 0.1 increase.

                        The residuals plots for this model are a slight improvement over the initial one. The residuals are more normal, though they do appear to trail off
                        at the edges still. The vs fit chart still trails upward, but again, that is likley due to only having two higher-fitted measurements. <br />
                        Several iterations of the final model were attempted to see if these defects in the model could be negated. However, none of them really improved any of
                        these charts. And so, either there are missing components that need to be understood in order to fully understand the model, or these slight deviations
                        are a side effect of the small sample size.
